# Emotion Detection 
This project follows through the process of building and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using the Keras API. 

### Data Preprocessing
ImageDataGenerator is used to preprocess images by rescaling the pixel values of the images for both trianing and validation datasets. 

### Required Packages 
- pip install numpy
- pip install opencv-python
- pip install keras
- pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow
- pip install pillow

### FER2013 Dataset
- The FER2013 dataset consists of 48x48 black and white images, categorized by different emotions 
- Specifically the 7 emotions used here are: Angry, Disgusted, Fearful, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprised
